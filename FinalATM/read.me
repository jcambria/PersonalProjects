In this program, the user is given four options: Deposit, Withdraw, Check Balance, or Exit.
The program maintains the user's account balance and allows them to deposit or withdraw funds. 
Additionally, the program prompts the user if they would like to apply exchange rate accordingly to their current balance.

Note that this program does not cover all edge cases and is provided only as an example. In a real-world application, you would need to consider additional security measures, input validation, and error handling.
