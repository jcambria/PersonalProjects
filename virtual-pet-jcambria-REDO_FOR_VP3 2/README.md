Have you ever heard of the game "Tamagotchi"? If not, check it out! This small application is similar.

In this application I used Java core concepts to simulate taking care of multiple pets.

Inside the shelter, where the pets are stored, there is both 'organic' dogs & cats along with 'robotic' dogs and cats.
Similar to real pets these virtual pets get hungry, thirsty, bored, and dirty.

The user is able to interact with the pets to pick an option to play with them, feed them, and many more.
These pets have scales that measure how they are doing in each category.
Robotic pets do not get hungry or thirsty.

However, robotic pets do need oil for maintenance and a boost when their batteries are running low.
The user is also given the ability to adopt a pet of their choice 'out' of the shelter and admit a pet of their choice 'in to' the shelter.

Feel free to clone this project to your local machine and have fun!
